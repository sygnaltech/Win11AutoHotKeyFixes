Open the Startup folder (current user) with Win+R, type shell:startup, and hit Enter—that opens %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. Drop a shortcut to startup.ahk (or to AutoHotkey.exe pointing at that script) into that folder. Next logon, Windows runs that shortcut automatically.
